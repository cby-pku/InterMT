Make sure the distance does not exceed 15 meters, as doing so will get you disqualified in a race. Go continue your practice again and try to beat your previous time in this exercise. Try big kicks and small kicks and get which one works best for you by comparing the time of each technique. The size and speed of the dolphin kicks can vary with different person's height and built.",

These individuals can can help guide you to the right psychological professional so that your child can be formally tested. Early diagnosis is important in helping children learn to cope with dyslexia.  Unmet needs in dyslexic children can have dire consequences for these children later in life. Studies have shown that more than one-third of students with dyslexia drop out of high school, which accounts for more than one-quarter of all high school drop-outs.   No one test can diagnose dyslexia. The standard battery of tests includes up to sixteen separate assessments. They examine all aspects of the reading process to see where the difficulties are occurring, compare reading level to reading potential based on intelligence, and test how students are most comfortable absorbing and reproducing information (audibly, visually, or kinetically).   Tests are usually set up through the child\u2019s school but for additional help, you can find a list of dyslexia centers and professionals by state .",

                    "response": "Educate yourself about the multiple types of bipolar disorder. There are four basic types of bipolar disorder that are regularly diagnosed: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and Cyclothymia. The type of bipolar disorder a person is diagnosed with is determined by its severity and duration, as well as how quickly the mood episodes cycle. A trained mental health professional must diagnose bipolar disorder; you cannot do it yourself and should not attempt to do so.   Bipolar I Disorder involves manic or mixed episodes that last for at least seven days. The person may also have severe manic episodes that put them in enough danger to require immediate medical attention. Depressive episodes also occur, usually lasting at least two weeks.   Bipolar II Disorder involves episodes of 'hypomania', which rarely escalates to full-blown mania, and more lasting episodes of depression. Hypomania is a milder manic state, in which the person feels very \u201con,\u201d is extremely active, and appears to require little to no sleep; other symptoms of mania such as racing thoughts, rapid speech, and flights of ideas might also be present, but unlike those in manic states, people experiencing hypomania do not generally lose touch with reality or the ability to function. Untreated, this type of manic state may develop into severe mania.   The depressive episodes in Bipolar II are generally assumed to be more severe and lasting than the depressive episodes in Bipolar I. It is important to note that a wide range of symptoms might be associated with both types I and II, and the experiences of every individual sufferer are different, so while conventional wisdom dictates as much, this is often, but not always the case.  Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS) is a diagnosis made when symptoms of bipolar disorder are present but don\u2019t meet the rigid diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). These symptoms are still not typical for the person\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d or baseline range.  Cyclothymic disorder or cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder. Periods of hypomania alternate with shorter, milder episodes of depression. This must persist for at least two years to meet diagnostic criteria.   A person with bipolar disorder may also experience \u201crapid cycling,\u201d in which they experience four or more mood episodes within a 12-month period. Rapid cycling appears to affect slightly more women than men, and it can come and go.",

Overconfidence, feelings of invulnerability, delusions of grandeur. A person having a manic episode may have an overinflated ego or higher sense of self-esteem than is typical for them. Thy may believe they can accomplish more than is feasible, as though absolutely nothing can get in their way. They may imagine that they have special connections to figures of importance or supernatural phenomena.  Increased, sudden irritability and anger.

They may choose to do activities, even seemingly purposeless ones, instead of sleeping or eating.  Increased talkativeness, scattered speech, racing thoughts. The person having a manic episode will often have difficulty collecting their thoughts, even though they are extremely talkative. They may jump very quickly from one thought or activity to another.  Feeling jittery or agitated. The person may feel agitated or restless. They may be easily distracted.  Sudden increase in risky behavior. The person may do things that are unusual for their normal baseline and pose a risk, such as having unsafe sex, going on shopping sprees, or gambling.

They may overeat or not eat enough. This varies depending on the person and represents a change from what is \u201cnormal\u201d for them.  Trouble concentrating. Depression can make it difficult to focus or make even small decisions. A person may feel nearly paralyzed when they\u2019re experiencing a depressive episode.  Suicidal thoughts or actions. Don\u2019t assume that any expressions of suicidal thoughts or intentions are \u201cjust for attention.\u201d Suicide is a very real risk for people with bipolar disorder. Call 911 or emergency services immediately if your loved one expresses suicidal thoughts or intents.",

Below are a few resources you may consider:  The National Institute of Mental Health is an excellent place to start for information on bipolar disorder, its symptoms and possible causes, treatment options, and how to live with the illness.   The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance offers resources for individuals living with bipolar disorder and their loved ones.   Marya Hornbacher\u2019s memoir Madness: A Bipolar Life talks about the author\u2019s lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder. Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison\u2019s memoir An Unquiet Mind talks about the author\u2019s life as a scientist who also has bipolar disorder. While each person\u2019s experience is unique to them, these books may help you to understand what your loved one is going through.   Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families, by Dr. Frank Mondimore, can be a good resource for how to care for your loved one (and yourself).   The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide, by Dr. David J.Miklowitz, is geared toward helping people with bipolar disorder, and their loved ones manage the illness.   The Depression Workbook: A Guide for Living with Depression and Manic Depression, by Mary Ellen Copeland and Matthew McKay, is geared toward helping people diagnosed with bipolar disorder maintain mood stability with various self-help exercises.",

It may be viewed as something they could just \u201csnap out of\u201d if they \u201ctried hard enough\u201d or \u201cthought more positively.\u201d The fact is, these ideas are simply not true. Bipolar disorder is the result of complex interacting factors including genetics, brain structure, chemical imbalances in the body, and sociocultural pressures. A person with bipolar disorder can\u2019t just \u201cstop\u201d having the disorder. However, bipolar disorder is also treatable.  Consider how you would speak to someone who had a different sort of illness, such as cancer. Would you ask that person, \u201cHave you ever tried just not having cancer?\u201d Telling someone with bipolar disorder to just \u201ctry harder\u201d is equally incorrect. Medication and therapy can help manage the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but the disorder can last a lifetime.   There\u2019s a common misconception that bipolar is rare. In fact, about 6 million American adults suffer from some type of bipolar disorder. Even famous individuals such as Stephen Fry, Carrie Fisher, and Jean-Claude Van Damme have been open about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder.   Another common myth is that manic or depressive mood episodes are \u201cnormal\u201d or even a good thing. While it\u2019s true that everyone has their good days and bad days, bipolar disorder causes shifts in mood that are far more extreme and damaging than the typical \u201cmood swings\u201d or \u201coff days.\u201d They cause significant dysfunction in the person\u2019s daily life.  A common mistake is to confuse with bipolar disorder. They are not at all the same illness, although they have a few symptoms (such as depression) in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized principally by the shift between intense mood episodes. Schizophrenia generally causes symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech, which do not often appear in bipolar disorder. It is possible for someone with schizoaffective disorder, to have the symptoms of both though.   Many people believe that people with bipolar disorder or depression are dangerous to others. The news media is particularly bad about promoting this idea. In reality, research shows that people with bipolar disorder don\u2019t commit any more violent acts than people without the disorder.  People with bipolar disorder may be more likely to consider or attempt suicide, however.",

                    "response": "Understand what causes whiteheads. Whiteheads are small, white bumps on the surface of the skin. They are usually the least severe type of acne, but may also occur alongside other types. Whiteheads and other acne breakouts can have a variety of causes. Understanding how whiteheads form can help you decide on treatment.  Hormonal changes in the body, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, can cause breakouts. Nearly 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 develop acne of some sort. Changes in medication such as hormonal birth control and certain psychiatric drugs can also trigger a breakout.  Excessive sebum production contributes to whiteheads and other types of acne. Sebum is an oily substance produced in hair follicles that can cause whiteheads and other acne breakouts when too much is absorbed by your skin. Most of the hair follicles on your body produce sebum, so it is possible to get whiteheads on other areas of your skin besides your face.  Some people are more genetically likely to develop whiteheads. White people are more likely than people of other races to develop whiteheads and other acne, and the tendency to get whiteheads can also be passed down in families.  Whiteheads have many causes, not all of which you can treat on your own. If your skin does not respond to at-home treatments, it's best to see a doctor even if your condition isn't severe. You may have other underlying health issues that are contributing to your whiteheads.",

Squeezing, picking, popping, or using an at-home extraction device on your own can worsen your whitehead problem because it may force the contents of the whitehead further into the skin.

Isotretinoin is a prescription medication that works by reducing your body\u2019s production of facial oil (sebum), one of the substances responsible for clogged pores that cause whiteheads. It also reduces inflammation and the presence of the skin bacteria P. acnes. In about 85% of patients with severe acne, isotretinoin treatments produce permanently clear skin in 4 to 5 months.  Isotretinoin goes by the brand names Absorica\u00ae, Accutane\u00ae, Amnesteem\u00ae, Claravis\u00ae, Myorisan\u00ae, Sotret\u00ae, and Zenatane\u2122. It is also available in generic form and is usually administered orally.   Isotretinoin has some possible severe side effects, such as the development of inflammatory bowel disease or psychiatric disturbance, that present potential risks. It is likely only to be prescribed in severe cases.   Because of the severity of some side effects, people who are prescribed isotretinoin must enroll in the ipledge\u2122 program created by the FDA. Among other things, those who take isotretinoin must not become pregnant, and they should not begin isotretinoin treatments while pregnant. People taking isotretinoin should also not donate blood while being treated and should stay out of the sun.",

Once you become educated, you will feel in command of yourself and your fears, which sets you on a path of healing.  The physical symptoms of a phobia include: sweating, shaking, feeling lightheaded, having difficulty breathing, panic attacks, crying, shaking, weeping, trembling, being constantly vigilant and never relaxing, avoidance and protective behaviors such as refusing to go out at night, obtain protective measures like watch dogs, electric fences, security systems with alarms.   Emotional signs of phobia include: overwhelming anxiety or panic, fear of losing control or going crazy, or knowing you are overreacting but feeling helpless to stop.   If you have been victimized in the past, then it is reasonable to expect that you would be fearful. It is when your thoughts, feelings and actions escalate to the levels noted above, you may in fact be experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.

Make an intricate maze with plenty of dead ends and turns so your gerbil doesn\u2019t get bored!",

However, a wound is more likely to get infected if it has not been properly cleaned and treated. Cuts on the feet, the hands, and other areas that commonly come into contact with bacteria are also especially susceptible. Bite and scratch wounds inflicted by an animal or a human are also more likely to become infected.  Keep a special eye on bites, puncture wounds, and crush injuries. Be careful when handling wounds from an unsanitary source: a crusty knife, a rusty nail, or a dirty tool.  If you've been bitten, talk with your doctor about your risk of getting rabies or tetanus. You might need antibiotics, or vaccines or other treatments against tetanus or rabies.  If you are healthy and your immune system is strong, most wounds will heal with little risk of infection.

Sure, it's great that you organized your home, your office space, or anything else in your life that needed to be put in its place, but that won't mean much if every time you come home, you throw your keys, the mail, umbrella, or other countless items wherever you feel like it because you're tired and you'll get to it later. Making a conscious effort to do this as much as you can will make a huge difference in how organized everything will look -- and how much better you'll feel.  Of course, it may not be realistic to expect you to put everything in its place the second you get to work or the moment you walk in the door. It can help a lot to have a \"random bin\" near the entrance of your front door so you can toss the items into the bin, knowing that you'll have to organize them as soon as possible. However, you can't let this bin pile up: you should make a goal of keeping it as empty as possible and going through it every morning and/or night, depending on how often you toss things in.  A lot of the trouble with this is mental. You may think that you don't possibly have the energy to sort through your mail or your school backpack, but if you just say, \"I'm going to spend five quick minutes organizing this stuff,\" you'll see that the task is manageable.

If your bed isn't made, it's much more likely that the rest of your bedroom will look chaotic, and that you won't be able to stay as organized as you'd like.

This will set your priorities for you, keep you focused, and will make you feel accomplished for doing the things you set out to do. However, different forms of list making work for different people, so you shouldn't feel compelled to do exactly what wikiHow or other websites tell you to do; find a list-making method that works for you and stick to it. Here are some things to keep in mind as you make your lists:  Consider making a weekly to-do list. Then, break up the things you need to get done each day so that all of the stuff you have to do feels less overwhelming. You'll feel a lot better about getting through that long list if you decide that you only have to get three things done on Monday.  Make a \"top 3\" list for the day. These are the things you really have to get done to feel better and to move forward. Don't do something easier and more fun, like returning a friend's phone call, when there are more pressing things to attend to, like paying those electric bills.  Don't feel compelled to write down every little thing you have to do. This can actually lead you to feel a bit more overwhelmed. If you have some of the easier tasks firmly planted in your head and go about doing them, you'll feel better about checking them off your list.  Avoid making an incredibly long list. Though your list can include some \"reach\" items that you'd like to do this week but can do the following week without the world ending, you should stick to the things you actually have time to accomplish. If you write down 40 tasks, then you'll just feel bogged down and overwhelmed and won't know where to start.  When you make your daily or weekly list, you can separate the items in terms of urgency. You can label them, \"Things I have to get done today,\" \"Things that need to get done this week\" or \"Things I have to do by the end of the month.\" or \"things that need to be done by the end of today\" This will help you put things in perspective and will help you prioritize your tasks.",

Make a habit of checking your planner every morning, updating it as needed, and even crossing off the things you had to do. Using colorful pens, markers, and highlighters can help as well, especially aesthetically.

Some of them cost money but people swear that they're worth it. Some of the most common apps are RescueTime, CalenGoo, Freckle, Things, and Mindnode. See if one of them works for you.

Devote 5 minutes a day to inspecting the cubbies, drawers, and boxes you've created and make sure that everything is where it should be.  Consider having a little cubby or drawer to organize the things you keep on the table in front of the TV. This could be where you place your remote, stray pens, magazines, and anything else you occasionally use in that room. This can look better than just throwing lose odds and ends on the table.  Consider having a drawer on your bookshelf for loose items. You may not have the perfect place for extra CDs, odd-sized books, albums, or other loose items that don't quite fit on your shelves but don't belong anywhere better. Using one of these on your shelves can help everything stay organized.  Use plastic trays under your kitchen and bathroom sinks. People tend to just throw plastic bags, cleaning supplies, detergent, and other household items under their kitchen sinks as well as a hodgepodge of beauty products and other paper products under the kitchen sink. Investing in just a few plastic drawers that can each be designated for certain items (such as a drawer for cleaning supplies or extra shower supplies) can help you feel more organized.",

You may feel constantly overwhelmed or like you're spinning out of control, desperately trying to check off a few items from your to-do list, because you never pause to take a break. Writing can help you do that. Writing down your thoughts and feelings, even if they have nothing to do with how to organize your life better, can make you feel more in control of your life, and can help you slow down long enough to get centered.",

Insurance companies are always employing attorneys to help save them money. In case they tell you that you do not need an attorney, you will know they're lying to you. They are trying to make you feel guilty for retaining counsel.  Some injuries \u2013 particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash \u2013 might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident.  Every insurance company uses the tactic delay, deny, defend to minimize the value of the victim's injuries for as little as possible.

If you're environmentally conscious, it may be difficult to find an alternative. However, if it's important to you, try to seek out non-vinyl liners in a store or online, but keep in mind they will be harder to maintain.  Weighted liners work best, as these stay in place more easily.  Look for mold-resistant curtain liners. They're more pricey, but you won't have to replace them as often.",

Make sure the trap has a center swivel and a reinforced base plate.  The central swivel will reduce the chances the coyote\u2019s foot is harmed by allowing the trapped coyote to pull on a heavy chain that is attached to the bottom of the trap. Cage traps don\u2019t work well with coyotes because they may shy away from them.

Instead, use simple, factual statements to explain your discomfort.  Stay calm. You might feel resentment, anger or frustration, but it's important to keep those emotions under control. While there may be plenty of negative emotions within you, focus on presenting a calm front and letting the other person know that you're not unstable or attacking but that you do mean business.  Stick with \"I\" language. It's easy to fall into the trap of saying things like \"you make me miserable\" or \u201cyou're a jerk,\u201d but all that does is make the other person defensive. Instead, stick with explaining how things impact you and start your sentences with such phrases as \"I feel\", \"I want\", \"I need\", \"I am going to\" and \"I am doing this from now on\".   If you're concerned that enforcing a boundary may seem like you don't want to help, you can explain the situation. For example, if a coworker asks for your help, you could say something like \u201cI would normally love to help you with that project, but my child's recital is tonight and I don't want to miss it.\u201d You can establish that you care about the other person without always caving to requests.  Don't reward hostile or manipulative behavior with positive consequences. \u201cTurning the other cheek\u201d when someone abuses you may only encourage them to continue that behavior.

For example, if you feel taken for granted because your contributions to a group project haven't been acknowledged, explain how your boss can remedy the situation. You could say something like \u201cMy name was the only one left off of that big project. I felt like my work wasn't valued when that happened. In the future, I'd like you to credit all the team members.\u201d  Another example: if you feel like your romantic partner is taking your love for granted because he or she doesn't express feelings clearly, offer some options that would help you feel appreciated. You could say something like \u201cI know you aren't into flowers and chocolates, but I would like you to occasionally express your feelings for me in a way that feels comfortable for you. Even a simple text during the day would really help me feel more appreciated.\u201d",

Write down the situation or behavior that has upset you and describe what you would like to see change. You don't have to memorize this verbatim; the point is to become comfortable with what you want to express so that you can communicate it clearly to the other person.   For example: imagine that you have a friend who often makes plans with you and then cancels at the last minute. You have begun to feel taken for granted because you don't feel like your friend respects your time. You might say something like the following: \"Sam, I want to talk to you about something that has been bothering me. We often make plans to hang out together and you end up canceling on me at the last minute. I feel frustrated by this because I usually can't make new plans with such short notice. I feel like you are taking my time for granted because I always agree to hang out with you when you ask. Sometimes I even wonder if you are canceling because you don't actually want to hang out with me. The next time we make plans together, I would like you to put them in your planner so you don't double-book that time. If you really have to cancel, I would like you to call me more than a few minutes beforehand.\"  Another example: \"Alex, I need to talk to you about babysitting. You asked me a few days ago if I could babysit your son next week, and I said yes. I agreed because I value your friendship and I want you to know that I'm there for you when you need me. However, I have already babysat for you several times this month, and I'm beginning to feel like I'm always on call. I would like you to ask other people to help out too, instead of always asking me.\"",

You want to keep your arms just over shoulder-width apart and keep both your back and legs straight for every repetition.   For more information on proper push-up technique, you can visit: .  Remember that you only go low enough for your chin to touch the floor while keeping the rest of your body elevated.",

These include:  The homeowner wants to avoid probate for their children. By creating a life estate, the property avoids and the remainderman immediately becomes the owner of the property upon the life tenant\u2019s death.  The property receives a step-up in basis. This means that when the government calculates capital gains taxes, value is calculated from the date of death, not from the date the original party acquired the property. Typically, there will be a greater increase in value from the date the property was acquired and therefore the tax owed on a property when sold would be much higher. By establishing a life estate, a parent could significantly reduce the amount of capital gains that a child has to pay.   A life estate may also be useful to qualify for medical assistance such as Medicaid, which limits the amount of assets you can own if you want support to pay a nursing home. The legal rules involving Medicaid are very complicated and you should contact a trust and estates attorney or an elder law attorney to assist you in making this determination.",

If the remaindermen refuse to agree to a sale, you are unable to sell the property.   A remainderman\u2019s legal problems could impact the property. Since the remainderman has a legal interest in the property, if they run into financial trouble, a lien could be placed on the property while the life tenant is still alive. While the claims may impact the property, a life tenant cannot be forced to leave the property.   A life estate may impact your ability to receive medical assistance to pay for nursing home care or in-home care.

Foxes eat birds as well, so be prepared for that possibility if you let both into your yard at the same time.  Leftover bird seed also attracts other animals, particularly rats and mice, so keep the feeders away from your home and sweep up every week.",

If you're a marathon runner, interval training could help you meet a specific goal like finishing in a shorter period of time.   Your goals should be specific and should address your aerobic performance (speed, distance, or both).  Make sure your goals are realistic.

Look for sections of honeycomb with no bees on them and remove them from the hive. Use a knife or uncapping tool to shave the wax off of honeycombs and put them in a large bucket.   Caps, which are freshly laid wax on the outer layers of a honeycomb, tend to be the easiest to melt and clean.  Take the beeswax between 9:00 am and 4:00 pm to avoid running into any angry bees.

Put your books on display, price them cheaply, and people will be snatching them up off your hands quicker than you can put them out!  Advertise your garage/yard sale a few days in advance for the most traffic. Place an ad in a local newspaper, or put up signs around your house so that people know where to come to.  If you have a friend with lots to sell, you can draw in more people by doubling up and creating a big yard sale.

Insert the screwdriver into that slit from the side, easing the tip beneath the cover as you do. Gently wiggle the screwdriver around until the plastic cover pops off.

Be patient. Some people say the older you are, the harder it is to change to left-handedness but that's misleading. The illusion that changing handedness is easier at a younger age comes from the fact that the higher the skill you have with your right hand, the lower the patience you have for a given amount of skill in your left hand. In fact, the older you are, the shorter it takes for your left hand to gain a given absolute amount of skill. The easiest, but most important thing you can do to strengthen your left hand is to use it to complete all of the actions and activities you would normally do with your right hand.  Make an effort to brush your teeth holding the toothbrush in your left hand. You can also comb your hair, pick up your coffee cup, butter your bread and open doors with your left hand, among many other daily activities.  Also try throwing darts (in a safe environment), playing pool, or throwing and catching a softball with your left hand  If you're finding it hard to remember, and keep using your right hand accidentally, try bandaging the fingers of your right hand together.

                    "response": "Start scoring. Just like in outdoor cricket, one team will bat first and the other team will field. In the second innings, the roles will be reversed. If your side is batting first, the goal is to score as many runs as possible. In indoor cricket, there are two ways to score- physical runs and bonus runs. For physical runs, both batsmen must complete a run from one crease to the other, that is, from the striker\u2019s crease to the non-striker\u2019s crease (or vice versa).  As mentioned before, the batsman only needs to run halfway down the pitch and not the whole length. Bonus runs can be scored when the ball hits a net and vary, depending on which part of the net you hit.  Hitting the ball in Zone A (the front net, i.e., the net behind the wicket keeper) won\u2019t get you any bonus runs.  If the ball hits the net in Zone B (side nets between the striker's end and halfway down the pitch), you get 1 bonus run.  If the ball hits the net in Zone C (side nets between the bowler\u2019s end and halfway), you score 2 bonus runs.  Hitting the ball in Zone D (the back net, i.e., the net behind the bowler) allows you to score 4 or 6 bonus runs depending on how the ball hits the back net. If the ball hits the net after bouncing, you get 4 bonus runs. If the ball hits the net without bouncing on the ground, you score 6 bonus runs.  If the ball hits Zone B or C onto Zone D , you score 3 bonus runs.  Remember that at least one physical run must be taken for any bonus runs to be scored. Whatever bonus runs you get will be added to the physical runs. For example, if you strike the ball into the front net for 1 bonus run and take 2 physical runs, you score a total of 3 runs off the ball.",

Dismissals take place in the same way as they do in conventional cricket, with a few differences.  Unlike conventional cricket, the batsman continues to bat after getting dismissed in indoor cricket. Each pair of batsmen will bat for 4 overs, no matter how many times you dismiss them. However, 5 run will be deducted from the batting team\u2019s total for each dismissal.  If the player is dismissed, the physical or bonus runs that might have been awarded on that ball won\u2019t be counted.  The batsman is declared out if he/she strikes the ball and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground, just like in outdoor cricket. In addition to this, a player can also be dismissed if the ball is caught after rebounding off a net, as long as it has not previously touched the ground (except when a \u201csix\u201d is hit).  The batsman can also be dismissed through the method of Mankad, which is much less common in outdoor cricket. This happens when the bowler completes the bowling action without actually releasing the ball and breaks the stumps at the bowling ending without letting go. If the non-striker is out of the crease, he/she is declared out.  Leg before wicket (lbw) is a valid form of dismissal in indoor cricket but is does not occur as often as it does in outdoor cricket.",

                    "response": "Fix the Lightning connector. If you think the Lightning connecter (the portion that goes into the iPhone) is the problem, the only way to fix it is to open it. Grab a cutter and a soldering machine.  Take the part of the cable that goes into the phone and slowly and carefully make a cut horizontally to separate the plastic. This needs to be done to expose the board.  Once a cut has been made around the circumference, separate the two parts of the plastic coating to reveal the board inside and the wires connecting to it.  Separate the two sections of wires. Once the board is exposed, there will be two different sections of wires going into the board. One section should be black and red; this is for the power supply. The other section can be various colors, but is most often green and white. Most likely, one or more of these wires have a loose connection with the board. Carefully separate the two sections of wires and straighten them out to identify their terminals.  Use a soldering machine to reattach all the wires to the board. Once all the terminals are exposed, grab a soldering machine and very carefully, one by one, attach each wire back to the board. This is the hardest but most crucial step. This is a very small piece of board and hence harder to work with. Be careful with the soldering iron, as it can get very hot.  Add glue around the wires to insulate it. You might want to add glow to insulate the wires you just attached so they do not touch with each other.  Reattach the two plastic portions that were cut off.  Using glue, reattach as precisely as you can the two portions of the plastic that was cut. It is very important to completely cover and insulate the board. Use more glue if needed to be safe but make sure if it completely attached and covered.",

The FDA has in fact issued warnings about using caffeine powder, because of the ease by which an inaccurate home measurement can lead to a dangerous overdose.

Ideally, you should rely on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep to provide you with the energy you need to get through the day.  Black coffee is probably your next best option, because it is low in calories and ingredients.

The thicker half of the reed is called the stock, and to moisten the reed you need to submerge that part of the reed into \u2044 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5\u00a0cm) of water. It's usually best to start the assembly process by soaking your mouthpiece, so it can work while you do the rest of the job.   The capillary action of the reed will pull water from the base to the tip. As the water reaches the middle of the reed, where the slice begins, take the reed out and quickly wet the end into which you blow.  Experiment with how saturated you let the reed get, and see what produces the best resonance for you. Two minutes before band practice starts is not the best time for this experiment.  Many reed players will moisten their reeds by sucking on them. For lots of players, it's a hassle to prepare a tiny glass of water to soak their reeds in the band room. While this is a common way of moistening your reed, you do risk mangling the reeds on your teeth. Some players likewise aren't thrilled about the idea of sucking on a bitter slice of cane. Soaking in water is a more uniform way of moistening the reed.",

There are over 120 different strains of HPV, only five to six of which are responsible for plantar warts. The virus is caught through exposure to skin scales that are infected by the virus.  Athletes who shower in common areas are at higher risk due to the increased number of people sharing the area, usually without protection over the feet. For instance, swimmers, both indoors and outdoors during the summer months, are at increased risk if they use communal showers and tiled areas around the pool; however, this includes all individuals who use a gym area locker room, shower cubicles, or hot tub areas where people usually walk barefoot.  Individuals who have cracked or peeling skin on the feet give the virus good entry into the body. Also, individuals whose feet remain moist or sweaty throughout the day will have an increased risk as the skin breaks down from overexposure to moisture increasing the risk the virus can gain entry to the body.  Individuals who have had plantar warts once are at higher risk of having them again. For instance, individuals who pick at a wart can spread the virus more easily to other parts of the body.  Individuals who have a compromised immune system from illnesses such as mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cancer, cancer treatments used for individuals with psoriatic arthritis, or individuals with HIV or AIDS.",

Where you hold the tournament depends on several factors:  Availability of the fish species you're fishing for. Generally, the lakes where B.A.S.S. and TWF hold their tournaments are noted among anglers for their populations of bass and walleye.  Accessibility to the anglers who'll be competing. While many remote lakes in Canada are noted for their populations of walleye, a reservoir such as Lake Oahe in South Dakota is more accessible to the majority of walleye anglers and thus a better tournament site.  Venue size. Generally, lakes and artificial reservoirs that host fishing tournaments are medium-to larger-sized lakes to accommodate the number of anglers who may take part.  Association with the organizing group. In most cases, organizations with a state or other jurisdiction in their group's name will want to hold their fishing tournaments within that jurisdiction's borders, assuming the above criteria are met. The Nebraska Walleye Association holds its tournaments at sites within Nebraska that are known for walleye; such as Merritt Reservoir, Lewis and Clark Lake, and Lake McConaughy; however, the Nebraska B.A.S.S.

                    "response": "Familiarize yourself with relevant fishing and boating regulations. These will depend on the jurisdiction where you plan to hold the tournament. Regardless of what other rules you plan to have for your tournament, you must conform to the bag and possession limits and any other regulations for the state or other jurisdiction where the fishing tournament is held, as well as to the legal methods for catching fish. You can find this information on the jurisdiction's fish and wildlife department's website. (The actual name of the department may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; it may be known as the Department of Natural Resources or the Game and Parks Commission, for example.)  Bag limits refer to the number of fish that may be caught per day. In many cases, tournaments restrict the number of fish caught per day on a multi-day tournament to fewer fish than the jurisdiction's limit.  Possession limits refer to how many fish an angler may have in his or her possession at any given time, whether on a stringer, in a cooler on site, or in a freezer at home. For tournaments where live fish are returned to the water after being weighed, possession limits are not a concern, but if the anglers competing are allowed to keep any or all of their catch, it may be.  Some species have minimum or maximum lengths or weights imposed by the state in order to ensure a suitable population for all anglers. In some cases, more stringent length and weight limits are imposed on a given lake or stream or during spawning season to ensure a sustainable fishery.  Boating regulations typically include such requirements as life jackets for each occupant of the boat, running lights for night use, and a kill switch for outboard motors of a certain horsepower or greater. Some jurisdictions in densely populated areas where the lake a tournament is to be held is used as a source of drinking water may require boats on that lake to be steam-cleaned and bear a sticker attesting to this.",

Tournaments generally determine a winner by total weight of fish caught during the tournament. In the event of ties, they may use the weight of the biggest fish caught as a tie-breaker.  What tackle may be used. Tackle is usually restricted to rods and reels and may be restricted by the type of rod and reel (as in fly-fishing tournaments) or even rod length. Participants may also be restricted as to how many rods they can have in use at a given time.  What fishing methods may be used. Depending on the tournament, this may mean disallowing trolling, snagging fish, or the use of live bait.  Whether participants fish alone or with a partner. Fishing tournaments where the participants fish from shore tend to allow their participants to fish alone, while tournaments where the participants fish from boats often pair anglers so that each can witness the other's actions.  Areas off-limits to fishing. Some tournaments have rules as to how close competitors may be to each other when fishing as well as a minimum distance from the host marina.  Participation/use of fishing guides. Some tournaments may allow guides to compete in tournaments on lakes and streams where they normally guide, provided they are not hired by any of the other participants during the tournament and for a period of time before it.  Allowing practice fishing prior to the tournament so participants may scout the lake for hot spots. Most tournaments allow this, although they may disallow it for a brief period before the event. (In its early years, the Bassmasters Classic kept the tournament site secret until just prior to the tournament, thus effectively prohibiting practice fishing.)  Handling/preservation of the fish. Many freshwater fishing tournaments require competitors to keep their fish alive until weighing, often with an in-boat live well or similar method, and many include either rewards or penalties related to the fish's condition at weigh-in. Live fish are usually returned to the water after weighing; dead fish may be donated to a charity such as a homeless shelter for feeding its residents.  Conduct of participants. This includes a stated expectation of good sportsmanship and may also include rules against seeding a spot with baitfish prior to the tournament, barring access to hot spots, and prohibition of alcohol or other drugs.  Legal issues and disputes. Tournaments may require competitors who use their own boats to have and carry proof of liability insurance for themselves and their passengers. They may also stipulate a time limit for submitting and a method for resolving disputes that arise.",

Choose shoes in a conservative color like navy, black, or brown.  In some situations, wearing sneakers that are specifically labeled \"business casual\" is also acceptable.

If you land on your heels, your body will act like a stiff board and will injure the rest of your joints and body.  3) You will not allow your legs to bend below 90 degrees. Bend below 90\u00b0 and you put too much strain on your knee joints and you slow yourself down.  4) When you have forward momentum, or are taking a higher drop, lean slightly forward and allow your hands to absorb some of the force.

Or you may try to read alone in your room with the door closed for 10-15 minutes before bed to get some \"you\" time. Fitting self-care into your schedule will be an important part of staying calm and balanced as an RA.  You should also get support from the other staff in the residence hall. This could be other RAs on your floor or your supervisor. Reach out to them if you need help with a resident issue or if you just want to destress and blow off steam after a long day.

As you're taking a breath, think about your first impulse \u2014 what you immediately want to do or say \u2014 and don't do it. Take another deep breath. Your first impulse will likely be to defend yourself when you feel attacked.   Think of your next reaction \u2014 then take another breath without acting on that impulse. You may also feel that it is necessary to retaliate when you feel attacked. This is not a healthy response, either.   Try to seek a solution or more information about what the person is telling you. For example, you can say, \u201cTell me more about how work is frustrating you.\u201d  Try using \u201cyes, and\u201d instead of \"yes, but.\" In this way, you are showing that you are listening to the other person, and building on it in a positive way.
